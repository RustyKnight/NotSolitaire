# NotSolitaire
A **very** basic implementation of solitaire using Swing

This is **NOT** a full implementation and I've deliberatly left some parts incomplere, the intention is to provide a learning jumping off point.

# What could be better
The card images - they are crap, but they are just a stand in.
The code could be better decoupled and/or make use of an appropriate rules engine, but the intention is to provide an initial jumping off point.
